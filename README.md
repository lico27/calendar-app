# calendar-app

## Description
An app to manage each hour of the working day by adding and saving tasks to colour-coded sections.

- Looped over time blocks to add colour coding (grey for past, orange for current, and green for future)
- Looped over save buttons to:
  - Retrieve any saved data from local storage so that input persists
  - Save inputted data to local storage
- Created function to show a temporary save confirmation message upon save button click

### Installation
